The purpose of this project is to simulate an Online Course Registration system, which is to be developed with a front-end web interface and a back-end database. 
The back-end database consists of Mysql and frontend web interface is developed using PHP and HTML. 
The need for structured storage, modification and maintenance of huge amounts of data has resulted in the emergence of the Database Management System (DBMS) as one of the core fields in the Computer Science industry. 
DBMS is the system of computer software that is aimed to provide a managing tool for maintaining the data, through various data models. 
The purpose of implementing this project is to understand the data modeling concepts that is used in a real time scenario and to implement a fully functional database system which interacts with a front end interface.
